Concept: Iterate through all of the "Baiting" achievements.  If there's one that
hasn't been completed, go to a known fishing site for that achievement, set the 
Release List so that you don't run out of inventory space with useless content, 
fish there using Versatile Lure until you complete the achievement.  Move on to 
the next unfinished achievement in order until done.  Also provide the option
for users to select specific Achievements from this list.
